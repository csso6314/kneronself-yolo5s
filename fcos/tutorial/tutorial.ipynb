    "Let's finetune a pretrained model on COCO128 custom dataset (located under yolov5 folder). The pretrained model we used here is the model with backbone Darknet53s, pan FPN type, trained on COCO dataset. We download the pretrained model from [Model_Zoo](https://github.com/kneron/Model_Zoo/tree/main/detection/fcos). Since COCO128 is small, we choose to freeze the pretrained model backbone.
